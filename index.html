          <p>I am Angela Murray. I have 3, soon to be 4, kids whom I love. I enjoy playing board games like Settelers of Catan and Robo Rally. We also like gardening. Currently we have a bed so full of mint that is has taken over everything. We have decided to leave the mint and not have anything else in that bed. There will be enough mint to harvest soon. When I harvest it I cut it close to the ground so other stems can take its place. Then I hang it upside down for a few weeks to dry. Once dry, I can store it for later use. Last year we gathered the seeds from this mint plant but htey were not needed because it has flurished on its own. This is a fun way to teach my kids patience and the importace of gardening and other skill. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
